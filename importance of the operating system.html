<h2>Following are the points that justify the need and importance of an operating system
<h2>

        <ol>
            
                <li>Operating system behaves as a resource manager. It utilizes the computer in a cost effective manner.Operating system behaves as a resource manager
                    . It utilizes the computer in a cost effective manner. It keeps account of different jobs and the where about of their results and locations in the memory.</li>
                <li>It schedules jobs according to their priority passing control from one program to the next. The overall function of job
                control is especially important where there are several users (a multi user environment).</li>
                <li>Operating system makes a communication link between user and the system and
                helps the user to run application programs properly and get the required output.</li>
            
            
                <li>Operating system has the ability to fetch the programs in the memory when required and not all the operating system to
                be loaded in the memory at the same time. Thus giving the user the space to work in the required package more
                conveniently and easily.</li>
                <li>Operating system helps the user in file management, making of directions, and saving files in them, is a very good
                feature provided by the operating system to organize data according to the needs of the user.</li>
                <li>Multiprogramming is a very important feature of operating system. It schedules and controls the running of several
                programs at once.</li>
                <li>It provides program editors that help the user to modify and update the program lines.</li>
                <li>Debugging aids provided by the operating system help the user to detect and rename errors in programs.</li>
                <li>Disk maintenance ability of operating system checks the validity of data stored on diskettes and perhaps make
                corrections to erroneous data.</li>

        <ol>
            <li>Cost</li>
            <p>Unless it is an open source operating system, generally all other platforms are considered to be expensive. Even though, users can choose the option of free operating system, it is not always the best since it does not posses 
                all the features. If the operating system includes GUI functionality, it increases the cost even more.</p>
            <li>Reliability</li>
            <p>An operating system is a vital software for any computer. Without an operating system, the computer cannot work.
            Therefore, any kind of failures in the operating system will result in affecting the entire computer. This in essence
            means that the processor will stop processing the data and other hardware components will not be working anymore.
</p>
            <li>Complexity</li>
            <p>The language that is used behind an operating system makes it more complex. This language cannot be understood by an
            average user. Hence, problems in the O/S cannot be resolved by just looking at its language.
</p>
            <li>Fragmentation</li>
            <p>Fragmentation is a process where storage memory is broken into fragments. Operating systems are also prone to internal
            fragmentations. If the process needs more space than it was allocated, it will cause insufficient storage space. As a
            result, the process will be using much less space than it requires causing internal fragmentation.
</p>
            <li>Virus Attacks</li>
            <p>The risk of viruses is always higher in an operating system. Sometimes users can unknowingly download malicious
            programs, visit malicious websites or open virus containing email attachments all which can make a computer vulnerable
            to viruses.</p>
